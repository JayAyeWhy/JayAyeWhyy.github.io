        <h1>What is slang</h1>
        <p>You know how language is always evolving? Well, slang is like the cool, informal language that people use to express themselves in a way that's hip and relevant to the current times. It's a bit like a secret code that changes with each generation, giving us words and phrases that capture the spirit of the moment. So, when you hear us talking about something being 'lit' or saying 'on fleek, we're just using slang to share our thoughts and feelings in a way that resonates with our generation. It's our unique way of keeping the language lively and fun!" </p>
